Group Members:Jacob, Danny/Rene, VJ, Maddox, Masimba.

Stop the Spread:

Testable: the iv will be affected by the dv because only one of the spots will have the most bacteria

Independent Variable: The one thing that we are going to change is the spot to see where the most bacteria will be, the bathroom, the stairs, the classroom, the wall way, or the grand stairs. Dependent Variable: We will measure the amount of bacteria in the two areas.

Constants: we will keep the same amount of space so we can see which spot has the most bacteria

Our Findings:

Name |	Location |	Form |	Elevation |	Margin |	Color |	gram value |	how much

here are some of the facts that we found:

Bacteria are single-celled prokaryotic creatures.

Due to their thicker cell walls and peptidoglycan's ability to bind to crystal violet, gram-positive cells are purple.

Gram-negative cells have a thinner cell wall, which gives them a pink color.

Up to 200 microns can be moved by a single bacterium every second.
